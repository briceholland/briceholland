I'm **Brice** — a father, Hubber, experienced entreprenuer, and IT guru. I'm currently focused on premium customer experiences and technical excellence as a Staff [Customer Reliability Engineer](https://github.com/premium-support) at GitHub.

Quick Bio:

My earliest technical experience started early on, hex-editing custom worlds for [Nox](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nox/) and building custom maps in Starcraft. I later started building stick figure animations with ActionScript and needed to host content, which scaled into system administration after [Geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities) outgrew my needs. I continued my full-stack journey, increasing my infrastructure knowledge and expanding into Cloud management at an MSP. My experience there allowed me to focus my ambitions toward building a more reliable future in DevOps, helping new team members entering the market and serving as an expert liasion for anyone interested in building better DevOps pipelines. I bring practical experience to business problems and identify how to build a better system. Today, I'm exposing myself to AI "replacement opportunities" that help force multiply my efforts, so that I have free time to spend innovating and building on ambitions.
