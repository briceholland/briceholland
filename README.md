### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com/?lines=Welcome+to+my+GitHub+profile!;I+love+development!)](https://git.io/typing-svg)


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a better GitHub within [Premium Support](https://github.com/premium-support)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NodeJS & MongoDB.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on exciting technology projects!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Ruby on Rails.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about GitHub, business management, stocks or any 90's era cartoon.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to create stick figure animations and began coding in [ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript) early-on. When I needed to find a place to host the animations, I turned to server administration!
